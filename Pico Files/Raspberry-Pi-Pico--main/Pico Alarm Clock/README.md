## Youtube Video Link
Please watch the video here and if you want to support the channel, press the like button and subsribe to the channel.


## Overview
This project is an easy alarm clock based on the Raspberry Pi Pico. The clock display the time and date on the popular 16x2 character LCD, and has an easy interface to set the alarm. The first button allows you to set an alarm, where the buttons next to add or substract 1 hr or minute and the last button is to confirm the alarm time.

This is a great project to make with your pico, as you will learn the basics of MicroPython and setting up components.



## Components needed

To follow along with this project you will need the following components:

- Raspberry Pi Pico
- 16 x 2 Character LCD display
- 11 Tactile push buttons
- 8 LED's
- 8 - 330 Ohm resistors
- Lot of wires and breadboard
- and finally patience



# Circuit Diagram 

To following along with the devlog circuit I have included the schematic diagram.

## PCB Design

I plan to make a simple PCB in the future to make it easier to eliminate the need of the breadboard, and ds1302 and buzzer module, by having a custom PCB.

## Libraries
To following along with this project we need the following libraries:
